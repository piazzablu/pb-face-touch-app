## How to stop touching your face in the times of COVID-19

A study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene found that a person touches their face 15.7 times in an hour on average. \
One of the five most important precautions you can take to protect yourself from the novel coronavirus infection is to avoid touching your face.\

We know this because we know how people catch viral infections - your hands can pick up the virus when they come in contact with a contaminated surface and transfer it to your nose, mouth or eyes when you touch your face. (The other important way coronavirus spreads is through sneeze and cough droplets.) \

Therefore it is very important to avoid touching your face and this little tool can help you detecting touches to your face.

## Getting Started

This is a simple HTML page with javascript. So you just need to run an http server to run it.
It uses tensorflow.js and the face and hand tracking models for tracking touches to your face.

### Prerequisites

To install a webserver via npm

```
npm install
```

Change to the directory and start the http server.

```
npm start
```

Then you can find the app on http://localhost:8080/
